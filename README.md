# Formula-Student-Chassis-Analysis
Structural analysis of Formula Student chassis to validate design safety under real load conditions.

## 🏎 Project Overview
This project focuses on the structural evaluation of a Formula Student chassis performed as part of my learning and training experience in vehicle structure design.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
• ANSYS – Structural Analysis 
• GitHub – Documentation  

## 📐 Load Cases Analyzed
• Front impact  
• Side impact  
• Bending  
• Torsion

## 📊 Results Summary

| Parameter | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Max Stress | 128751 MPa |
| Max Deformation | 7.2203 mm |

## ✅ Conclusion
The chassis design met safety limits under the defined loading conditions and showed acceptable structural rigidity based on student-level validation.

## 🔍 Scope for Improvement
• Weight optimization  
• Compliance with rulebook specifics  
• Mesh optimization  
• Material trade study
